It contains a set of 100 events, created by MadGraph via <code>generate p p > t t~ > vl l+ vl~ l- b b~</code>, stripped of all non-necessary information such as the run card and parameter card. A similar code was used to obtain the results of Section 5 [doi:10.1007/JHEP09(2020)029](https://inspirehep.net/literature/1798660).<br>It makes sense to first have a look at the other example, where we resum the non-global logarithms of a similar rapidity gap but start from one single dipole, as we will not go into every detail here.
